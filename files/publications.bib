  title    = "PrAna: an interactive web-based tool to explore prescribing data in England with spatiotemporal trends",
  abstract = "During the last decade, wide range of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) have been identified and quantified in aquatic environment across several studies and indicated their impacts on exposed environmental species and humans. For the prediction of total amount of the APIs released to the environment, information about APIs consumption data is vital. Globally, several methods were reported to estimate the APIs consumption data based on the national prescription data, manufacturers, importers and dispenser’s data. In the UK, national prescription data provided by National Health Service was used to calculate the consumption data, however, they are limited to a geographical region and or to a group of drugs. The aim of this study is to aggregate and normalize prescription data to calculate total prescribed quantity of different APIs and to develop a tool, to explore spatiotemporal trends of different APIs using the processed dataset for wider use.",

  abstract  = "Great strides have been made to encourage researchers to archive data created by research and provide the necessary systems to support their storage. Additionally it is recognised that data are meaningless unless their provenance is preserved, through appropriate meta-data. Alongside this is a pressing need to ensure the quality and archiving of the software that generates data, through simulation, control of experiment or data-collection and that which analyses, modifies and draws value from raw data. In order to meet the aims of reproducibility we argue that data management alone is insufficient: it must be accompanied by good software practices, the training to facilitate it and the support of stakeholders, including appropriate recognition for software as a research output.",

  abstract  = "Using molecular simulation to aid in the analysis of neutron reflectometry measurements is com- monplace. However, reflectometry is a tool to probe large-scale structures, and therefore the use of all-atom simulation may be irrelevant. This work presents the first direct comparison between the reflectometry profiles obtained from different all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simu- lations. These are compared with a traditional model layer structure analysis method to determine the minimum simulation resolution required to accurately reproduce experimental data. We find that systematic limits reduce the efficacy of the MARTINI potential model, while the Berger united- atom and Slipids all-atom potential models agree similarly well with the experimental data. The model layer structure gives the best agreement, however, the higher resolution simulation-dependent methods produce an agreement that is comparable. Finally, we use the atomistic simulation to ad- vise on possible improvements that may be offered to the model layer structures, creating a more realistic monolayer model.",

The work demonstrates the value of the molecular dynamics code, DL_POLY and Monte Carlo code, DL_MONTE sharing common input formats to enhance the compatibility of the codes, being supported by DL_FIELD. Structures generated using cellulose-builder were processed by DL_FIELD to generate input files for DL_POLY using the OPLS_2005 force field. After relaxation in molecular dynamics, structures were used for GCMC simulations in DL_MONTE before passing back to DL_POLY to evaluate transport properties at different levels of sorption. While no hydrogen sorption was seen in pure crystalline cellulose, increasing separation between layers did allow sorption. When slit-pores were sufficiently wide, interactions with the cellulose led to the volumetric density of adsorbed hydrogen exceeding vacuum density at accessible partial pressures as well as allowing diffusion through the system. These model systems can give useful insight into the behaviour of amorphous cellulose in future simulation and experiment.",

These include the ability to treat systems confined to a planar pore (i.e. ‘slit’ or ‘slab’ boundary conditions); the lattice-switch Monte Carlo (LSMC) method for evaluating precise free energy differences between competing polymorphs; various commonly used methods for evaluating free energy profiles along transition pathways (including umbrella sampling, Wang–Landau and transition matrix); and a supplementary Python toolkit for simulation management and application of the histogram reweighting analysis method. We provide two ‘real-world’ examples to elucidate the use of these methods in DL_MONTE. In particular, we apply umbrella sampling to calculate the free energy profile associated with the translocation of a lipid through a bilayer. Moreover, we employ LSMC to examine the thermodynamic stability of two plastic crystal phases of water at high pressure. Beyond this, we provide instructions on how to access DL_MONTE and point to additional information valuable to existing and prospective users.",

  title     = "A Domain Specific Language for Performance Portable Molecular Dynamics Algorithms",
  abstract  = "Developers of Molecular Dynamics (MD) codes face significant challenges when adapting existing simulation packages to new hardware. In a continuously diversifying hardware landscape it becomes increasingly difficult for scientists to be experts both in their own domain (physics/chemistry/biology) and specialists in the low level parallelisation and optimisation of their codes. To address this challenge, we describe a ``Separation of Concerns'' approach for the development of parallel and optimised MD codes: the science specialist writes code at a high abstraction level in a domain specific language (DSL), which is then translated into efficient computer code by a scientific programmer. In a related context, an abstraction for the solution of partial differential equations with grid based methods has recently been implemented in the (Py)OP2 library. Inspired by this approach, we develop a Python code generation system for molecular dynamics simulations on different parallel architectures, including massively parallel distributed memory systems and GPUs. We demonstrate the efficiency of the auto-generated code by studying its performance and scalability on different hardware and compare it to other state-of-the-art simulation packages. With growing data volumes the extraction of physically meaningful information from the simulation becomes increasingly challenging and requires equally efficient implementations. A particular advantage of our approach is the easy expression of such analysis algorithms. We consider two popular methods for deducing the crystalline structure of a material from the local environment of each atom, show how they can be expressed in our abstraction and implement them in the code generation framework.",

To exploit diverse modern manycore hardware, efficient codes must use all available parallelism. At the same time they need to be portable and easily extendible by the domain specialist (physicist/chemist) without detailed knowledge of this hardware. To address this challenge, we recently described a new Domain Specific Language (DSL) for the development of performance portable MD codes based on a {"}Separation of Concerns{"}: a Python framework automatically generates efficient parallel code for a range of target architectures. Electrostatic interactions between charged particles are important in many physical systems and often dominate the runtime. Here we discuss the inclusion of long-range interaction algorithms in our code generation framework. These algorithms require global communications and careful consideration has to be given to any impact on parallel scalability. We implemented an Ewald summation algorithm for electrostatic forces, present scaling comparisons for different system sizes and compare to the performance of existing codes. We also report on further performance optimisations delivered with OpenMP shared memory parallelism.",

  title    = "Phase Transformations and Ion Exchange During Early Age Carbonation",
  abstract = "The exchange of ions during the dissolution of Portlandite and precipitation of newly formed carbonate phases, at the beginning of the carbonation reaction has been investigated. Changes in the isotopic composition of carbonates was determined using Time-of-Flight-Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry and Raman spectroscopy. Samples of pure Ca(18OH)2 were carbonated in humid air (containing almost exclusively 16O) and characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy and Raman Spectroscopy, aided by Density Functional Theory calculations. Results show that the carbonation process at high pH (i.e. >12) is a two-stage mechanism. The first stage occurs over a short period of time after the Ca(18OH)2 is exposed to air and involves the dissolution of surface Ca2+ ions and hydroxyl 18OH- groups. The latter react directly with the dissolved CO2, leading to the formation of C18O16O22- ions containing 1/3 of 18O. Since this ion is the precursor of the newly formed carbonate phases, a similar oxygen content was found in the precipitates. The 18O:16O ratio of 1:2 in the carbonates at the beginning of the reaction is in agreement with a carbonation model proposed by L{\'e}tolle and colleagues in 1990 [1] describing a direct reaction of CO2 with the OH- groups produced by the dissociation of water. The second stage of the reaction occurs within 24 hours of exposure to air and involves a rebalance of the oxygen isotopic composition in the carbonate phases with a higher concentration of 16O.",

Dolomitic lime binders are produced at lower temperatures than cement, re-adsorb released CO2 during strengthening, and are recognised for their superior permeability, flexibility and resilience. While dolomite consists of alternating layers of magnesium and calcium the distribution in dolomitic lime is not yet fully understood. Here we combine experimental and computational methods to confirm that dolomite phase separates into lime and periclase during thermal decomposition. Raman inactivity of decomposed dolomite agrees with XRD studies suggesting phase separation. Our results rule out the formation of mixed phase oxides and predict an upper bound for bulk and surface substitution defect concentrations. Transferred to study macroscopic models of lime mortars these findings indicate that only the pure phases need be considered and that for the construction industry superior artificial mortars should be obtained from mixing fine powders of pure magnesium and calcium hydroxide.",

This paper describes developments of this work and how the combination of stable isotopes, atomic force microscopy (AFM), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and atomistic modelling can provide new insights into the dissolution and carbonation mechanisms of lime. In this research AFM and atomistic modelling were used to investigate the dissolution mechanism of nano-sized Portlandite (Ca(OH)2) crystals. Experimental and computational results highlight differences in the solubility of {100}, {010} and {001} crystallographic faces. The {001} faces were shown to be the most stable. SIMS and Raman spectroscopy of 18O-labelled calcium hydroxide and computational techniques have allowed investigation of previously unknown details of the carbonation mechanism. Experimental results provide the first evidence of the theory proposed by Letolle and colleagues in 1990 regarding the formation of the carbonate ion (CO32-) by direct reaction of the hydroxyl ions (OH-) with carbon dioxide (CO2) dissolved in water. New insights into the transformation of meta-stable carbonates into stable phases in the first few minutes of carbonation are also reported.",
